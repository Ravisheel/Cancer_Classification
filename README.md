# Cancer_Detector
In this project I made Cancer Classification models using Dimensional Reduction techniques which can predict Breast Cancers


1) Data set Description
2) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3) Correlation Analysis and Distribution 
4) Feature Engineering (t-sne,PCA, Scaling)
5) Multiple Linear Regression (R^2, AdjR^2, RMSE, Residuals vs Fitted)
6) Scatter plot of 2 Class
7) Training and Testing of Model:
    1) With All Columns of Data set (Normal Method)
    2) With PCA features (Optimal Method)
    3) Models:- LDA, Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayesian, Random Forest 
8) Conclusion

## Attribute information

1)  ID number
2)  **Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)**
3)  3-32)

## Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

    a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
    b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
    c) perimeter
    d) area
    e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
    f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
    g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
    h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
    i) symmetry 
    j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

## Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant
